# Lab 5: Database Design and Selecting a Primary Key

## What you should takeaway from this lab?
- Definitions: 1) primary key 2) surrogate key
- How should I choose a primary key for a table?
- For the same table, how different primay key strategies affect the performance of the database at large scale?
- What about foregin key strategy?

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| INSERT    |                 |
| GET       |                 |

## A simple database for our lab use.
Let's imagine that we have a LeetCode Contest that all students in Northeastern Universtiy can participate in.
- The contest run 24 hours. 
- The estimated number of students is 1000.
- The contest last for 12 hours.
- There will be 10,000 commits in total.

We want to record the records in a table called ***records***:

| RecordID | Student | ProblemID | PassOrFail | SubmitTime | Runtime |
|----------|---------|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| 1        | Fac     | 111       | true       | 11:00      | 12      |
| 2        | Lin     | 222       | true       | 12:00      | 17      |
| 3        | Ama     | 222       | false      | 11:00      | 17      |
| 4        | Goo     | 333       | false      | 12:00      | 12      |

- RecordID: int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
- Student: varchar(255) NOT NULL
- ProblemID: int
- PassOrFail: boolean
- SubmitTime: time
- Runtime: int

## What are the primary keys you can choose?
- What should I choose for my primary key?

- Google other articles about "primary key" if you are still confused.

Please list your primary key strategies somewhere you can refer to :
- Option 1:
- Option 2:
- Option 3:
- ...
Please make assumptions of the performance of each strategy in your mind or write them down.

### Try different primary key strategies and analysis their performances and why?
- Example 1: use a auto increment record ID as primary key
- Example 2: use a [Student, ProblemID, SubmitTime] as primary key.

### Test your primary key strategies's performance with ***mysqlslap***
[Official Documentation on mysqlslap](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlslap.html)
- Step 1: Open your MySQL Workbench
- Step 2: Create a database connection on your local host port 3306.
- Step 3: Open ***mysqlslap*** on your terminal and execute the following command line:
(The following is a windows command. Mac users can take as a reference.)
Please figure out what each flag means before executing the command.
```
PS C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin>.\mysqlslap --concurrency=1 --iterations=1 --create='C:\Users\jxyzs\Desktop\create_table1.sql' --query='C:\Users\jxyzs\Desktop\fake_records.sql' --password --delimiter=";" --no-drop
```
- Step 4: Wait ............. Wait ............ until you see a report on your command line
- Step 5: Go to your MySQL Workbench, open the local connection, open ***Schemas*** on the left column (It's beside ***Administration***). refresh SCHEMAS. You will see ***mysqlslap*** as one of your schemas. Inspect the table called ***records***. 
- Step 6: drop schema ***mysqlslap***
- Step 7: Try the same command line with ***create_table2.sql*** and check both the command line report and table ***records*** in your MySQL Workbench. You would see the difference. Please think about their impact on your project if the number of records is in millions. 
- Step 8: Explore yourself and think about different primary key strategies' impact on other types of queries in terms of time complexity and space complexity.
